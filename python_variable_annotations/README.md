# 🐍 Python Type System Project

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain the following concepts — no Googling required!

### ✅ Type Annotations in Python 3
- Understand how Python supports type hints using syntax like `def greet(name: str) -> str`.
- Know the difference between dynamically typed vs statically typed languages.
- Appreciate how type hints improve code readability and help with tooling.

### ✍️ Using Type Annotations
- Use type annotations to declare expected argument and return types.
- Explore built-in types (`int`, `str`, `float`, `list`, `dict`, etc.) and advanced ones like `Optional`, `Union`, and `Any`.
- Practice writing self-documenting code using annotations.

### 🦆 Duck Typing
- Explain Python’s philosophy: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...”
- Understand how behavior matters more than inheritance or strict types.
- Use duck typing to write flexible and reusable code.

### 🔍 Code Validation with `mypy`
- Learn how to run `mypy` to check type correctness without running your code.
- Catch common bugs and type mismatches early in development.
- Integrate `mypy` into your workflow with CI tools or pre-commit hooks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install `mypy` with pip if needed:

```bash
pip install mypy
